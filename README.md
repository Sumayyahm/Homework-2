# Portfolio


1. I have created a Portfolio site that contains a Home/About page(index.html) with a Contact page(contact.html) and a Portfolio page(portfolio.html).
2. Each page includes a navbar(from Bootstrap) that contains links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages and footer. 
3. I have included my personal information (bio,name and image).
4. I have utilised Bootstrap components.
5. I have made the site responsive using Bootstrap grid system.
6. I have added semantic html elements wherever possible.
7. I have made commits whenever I made substantial changes in the html docs


URL of the deployed website: https://sumayyahm.github.io/Portfolio/
